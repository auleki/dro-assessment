# DRO - FRONT-END DEVELOPER ASSESSMENT 

## Steps To Running The Application
- Clone the repository
- Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn install``` (based on your package manager) in your terminal
- Run ```npm start``` or ```yarn start```
- If a window with url http://localhost:3000 does not pop up on your window, navigate to it
